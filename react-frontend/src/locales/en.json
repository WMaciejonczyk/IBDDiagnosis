  "overview3": "Definitions",
  "overview4": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD)",
  "overview5": " – a group of chronic inflammatory diseases of the digestive system, primarily including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These conditions are characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation leading to mucosal damage in the intestines.",
  "overview6": "Ulcerative Colitis (UC)",
  "overview7": " – a chronic inflammatory disease limited to the outer mucosal layer of the colon and rectum, where inflammation is continuous within the affected tissues. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and mucosal inflammation.",
  "overview8": "Crohn's Disease (CD)",
  "overview9": " – a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly the terminal ileum and colon. Inflammation is transmural, involving all layers of the intestinal wall and leading to fistulas, abscesses, and intestinal strictures.",
  "overview10": "Classification",
  "overview11": "The most common types of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Rare cases that cannot be clearly classified into the above categories due to features of both diseases are designated as unclassified inflammatory bowel diseases (UIBD). The Montreal classification is most commonly used in diagnostics, taking into account extent and severity for UC and age, location, and disease course for CD.",
  "overview12": "Etiopathogenesis",
  "overview13": "The etiology of IBD is not fully understood. Despite differences in pathogenic mechanisms, both diseases share common sources in areas such as genetic predisposition, environmental factors, gut microbiota composition, and immune system responses:\n",
  "overview14": "Genetic",
  "overview15": " – associated with mutations in genes affecting the immune system, such as NOD2, ATG16L1, IRGM, IL23R, IL12B, JAK2, or STAT3.",
  "overview16": "Environmental",
  "overview17": " – involve factors such as a diet high in fats and sugars but low in fiber, smoking, use of certain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral contraceptives, or antibiotics, stress, and a weakened immune system due to reduced exposure to gut bacteria over a lifetime.",
  "overview18": "Microbiological",
  "overview19": " – associated with microorganisms such as ",
  "overview20": "Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis",
  "overview21": " or ",
  "overview22": "Escherichia coli.",
  "overview23": " Protective effects against IBD have been demonstrated by ",
  "overview24": "Helicobacter pylori.",
  "overview25": "Immunological",
  "overview26": " – in the case of innate immunity, mutations in NOD2, ATG16L1, and IRGM disrupt processes such as microbial detection, autophagy, and epithelial barrier integrity, contributing to disease development. For adaptive immunity, which operates through targeted responses using specialized antibodies, studies have shown a link between lymphocyte subpopulations responsible for triggering immune responses, such as Th1, Th2, and Th17, and inflammatory bowel diseases.",
  "overview27": "Diagnostics",
  "overview28": "IBD is diagnosed using colonoscopy, gastroduodenoscopy, and imaging studies such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, laboratory markers (e.g., CRP, calprotectin) and serological markers (e.g., ANCA, ASCA) are analyzed.",
  "overview29": "Treatment",
  "overview30": "IBD is currently incurable. Therapy focuses on symptom relief, as well as inducing and maintaining remission:",
  "overview31": "Aminosalicylates",
  "overview32": " – e.g., mesalazine, particularly effective in UC.",
  "overview33": "Corticosteroids",
  "overview34": " – e.g., hydrocortisone, prednisolone, used to induce remission.",
  "overview35": "Immunosuppressants",
  "overview36": " – e.g., thiopurines, methotrexate, limit inflammatory responses.",
  "overview37": "Biopharmaceuticals",
  "overview38": " – e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
  "overview39": "Despite their effectiveness, the above medications can be costly and cause various side effects.",
